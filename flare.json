The kids often seemed like they were sitting around waiting for next area and most of staff was goofing around, not engaged or watching the kids.  Please also do not serve PORK at camp. Sometimes we weren't sure and no one at the park could confirm. This is really bad.","park_name":"Chase Park","sentiment":"Very Negative"},

My daughter at Wilson on Racine, loved all the activites and they changed it up.  My son was at Ping Tom.  He enjoyed his experience but at times wanted things to be changed up a bit.  They followed a schedule and at times, he wanted a change (e.g., swimming daily).  Overall, both kids had a great experience and I will definitely enroll them next summer!","park_name":"Ping Tom Park","sentiment":"Positive"},

Frankly, it was one of the main reasons I wanted my children to attend.","park_name":"Washington Park","sentiment":"Positive"}]},
